## Unreleased

* Added non-scrollable `ZefyrView` widget which allows previewing Notus documents inside
  layouts using their own scrollables like ListView.
* Breaking change: renamed `EditableRichText` to `ZefyrRichText`. User code is unlikely to be
  affected unless you've extended Zefyr with custom implementations of block widgets.
* Breaking change: renamed `RenderEditableParagraph` to `RenderZefyrParagraph`. User code is
  unlikely to be affected unless you've extended Zefyr with custom implementations of block widgets.
* Added `ZefyrScope` class - replaces previously used scope objects `ZefyrEditableTextScope` and
  `ZefyrEditorScope`. Unified all shared resources under one class.
* Breaking change: removed `ZefyrEditor.of` and `ZefyrEditableText.of` static methods.
  Use `ZefyrScope.of` instead.

This version introduces new widget `ZefyrScaffold` which allows embedding Zefyr in custom
