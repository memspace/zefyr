## Clean and modern look

Zefyr's rich text editor is built with simplicity and flexibility in
mind. It provides clean interface for distraction-free editing. Think

## Markdown-inspired semantics

Ever needed to have a heading line inside of a quote block, like in
this Markdown block:

> ### I'm a Markdown heading

## Ready for collaborative editing

Zefyr's document model uses data format compatible with
[Operational Transformation][ot] which makes it possible to use for
collaborative editing use cases or whenever there is a need for
conflict-free resolution of changes.

> Zefyr editor uses Quill.js **Delta** as underlying data format. Read
> more about Zefyr and Deltas in our [documentation](doc/concepts/data-and-document.md).
> Make sure to checkout [official documentation][delta] for Delta format
> as well.
